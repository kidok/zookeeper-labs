Lab 1.1 : Install ZooKeeper locally
===========================

### Overview
Install ZooKeeper on a local server

### Depends On 
None

### Run time
10 mins

## STEP 1: Download the latest stable version of ZooKeeper

## STEP2: Unzip the download

(for example)

    tar xf zookeeper-3.4.8.tar.gz

## STEP 3: configuration

Assuming you have downloaded and unpackaged a ZooKeeper distribution, go to a
shell, change directory ( cd ) to the projectâ€™s root, and rename the sample configuration
file:

    mv conf/zoo_sample.cfg conf/zoo.cfg
    
It is a good idea to change the ZK data directory in the zoo.cfg file
    
    dataDir=/users/me/zookeeper
    
(why? - give two reasons)
    
# STEP 4: Start ZooKeeper server
    
    ./zkServer.sh start
    ZooKeeper JMX enabled by default
    Using config: /home/mark/zookeeper-3.4.8/bin/../conf/zoo.cfg
    Starting zookeeper ... STARTED
